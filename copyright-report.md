## Assignment 4 - Copyright

## 1. Platform Copyright Policy Analysis
### **Platform: YouTube**

YouTube Copyright Policy: https://www.youtube.com/howyoutubeworks/copyright/

### Detection
YouTube detects copyrighted content using a *Content ID*, which is an automatic system
that creates a digital fingerprint unique to the content. Basically, when a user
uploads something, it is then scanned and compared against a massive database
of reference files submitted by people who own the copyright to the content. The 
rightsholders can choose rules for when content matches are found, and they can
choose to block the entire video, monetze the video by running ads against it, or track
the amount of views the video gets. 

### Content Flagging / Infringement
When the Content ID finds a match with another upload, the rights holder can pick 
from a set of options on what to do next:
1. They can **block** the video, meaning that it is removed from YouTube, which can be done
on a region or global level.
2. They can **monetize** the video by putting ads onto the content, and all of the
ad revenue will go directly to the copyright owner.
3. They can **track** the video and collect all of the viewer data.

### Appeals and Counter-Nofitications
A user is able to dispute a claim if they think that they have the right to use the content under Fair user, but the owner can reject the dispute. At this point, the user can appeal again, but if they are rejected again or found to be in the wrong, then this will add a **Copyright Strike** to the channel, which is a formal penalty.

### Monetization
As mentioned above, if the rights holder decides to leave the video up, they can
monetize the video with ads, and all of the ad revenue will go to the rights holder.

### Special Programs
YouTube has Content ID licencing agreements. For example, a lot of record labels like Universal, Sony, and Warner Bros have signed a blanked licensing agreement with YouTube. This menas that instead of suing the companies for using a song, they agree to let your video stay up if they get to place ads on the video and keep the money. 

Another special program YouTube has is YouTube Creator Music. Basically, there is a marketplace in YouTube Studio, and creators can browse a catalog of popular music and either buy a license or pay nothing upfront, but then agree to split your video's revenue with the artist. This means that YouTube creators can use copyrighted music without losing all of the revenue from the video.

## 2. Fair Use Experiments
### Raw Copyrighted Clip
I first uploaded just a 30 second clip from the song Style by Taylor Swift. During the upload, YouTube studio caught that it had copywritten content and said that I could still upload based on Taylor Swift's content guidelines. The video is unmonetized, but if Taylor Swift decided she wanted to monetize the content, I am sure she would have the ability to do so.

### Edited Clip
I edited together two different Taylor Swift videos (I figured they would definitely be heavily monitored) using an online video editor. I also added in some GIFs and some other random images. During the upload phase, it scanned my content and did not generate any copyright violations, so I was cleared to upload. The video is still up and hasn't been blocked or demonetized.

## 3. AI-Generated Content Investigation

### AI-Generated Music Video
The prompt I used was "generate a music video with music in the style of taylor swift. Make it have similar color palettes, similar dancers, similar movements, etc. Make it hyper accurate" in Gemini. I was able to upload the video without any copyright violations, and so far the video is still allowed.

### AI Generated Animation
The prompt I used was "create an avatar the last airbender animation, very similar to the style and artwork of the original show. Show Aang airbending and katara waterbending" in Gemini. Similar to the first generated video, I was able to upload the video without any copyright violations, and so far the video hasn't been flagged or taken down.

### AI-Generated Content Research
The policy for Google Veo3 is included in the Generative AI Additional Terms of Service and says that I own the generated content. In terms of copyright, the content is public domain, and this is due to the US Copyright Office. The rule says that if a work was created entirely by AI, then it is not eligible for copyright protection. Finally, if you upload content that looks realistic on YouTube, you ahve to check a specific AI content button to specify that it is AI. If you don't label it, then YouTube has the right to remove the content and demonetize your account.

## 4. Legal Analysis
### Experiment 1 - Raw Copyrighted Clip
i. The purpose and characterw as not transformative because I was directly copying existing content.
ii. The existing song is creative, so when I directly copy it I am committing a violation. 
iii. I used 30 seconds, which is significant enough for a viewer to know that this is a Taylor Swift song.
iv. I wouldn't say that this is going to take away from the market or the original music video in any significant way, but it could pull some users away if they click on my video instead of the original.
